This textfile just has interlaced yaml that will accumulate to a sensible ParameterDescription ParameterDescription
We do this by marking yaml files at the start with #=

One should start with an overarching structure
#= about:
#=   - description: What this is about
#=   - author:
#=      - name: Marc Portier
#= parameters:


after which we can just describe one parameter a time
#=     firstparam:
#=       - description: the first param


Thanks for reading up to here!
